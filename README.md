# PeriBot Source Stuff
This is not the full source code for PeriBot, just some snippets of various parts. 
I've posted this here so that I can referance it when I'm out and about, instead of going to my computer every time I want to brainstorm new features, solutions to issues, etc.

This isn't posted with others in mind, so im not organizing it or making it easy to just clone and use. Maybe later when I'm fully done with the project, though.
